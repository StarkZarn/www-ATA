# Educational Materials and Texts

**Gleim Pilot Kit**
At About Time Aviation, we use textbooks and study guides published by Gleim for ground school. Packed full of information, including all the questions to the written test and full explanations of the correct answers, these books are an invaluable part of your learning experience.

Gleim offers a variety of kits for different pilot ratings (e.g. private pilot, commercial pilot, instrument pilot, etc.). These kits each contain not only the text books you will need to study, but other tools and gear you may find helpful and convenient. However, texts can also be purchased on an individual basis directly from Gleim, or at online outlets such as Amazon.com, eBay, etc. We stock the private pilot kit for $150 (a nice savings if you were to purchase items individually) and it has everything you need to get started including:

- Flight Bag
- Gleim Cap
- Flight Computer
- FAR/AIM
- Logbook
- Pilot Handbook
- Plotter
- Private Pilot Flight Maneuvers and Practical Test Prep
- Private Pilot FAA Knowledge Test
- Private Pilot Knowledge Test Prep Software Download
- Private Pilot Syllabus book
- Private Pilot Training Record book

**Other Handy Items**

As a student pilot you will require a variety of tools and reference materials that you will always want to have with you as you prep for and carry out flights. Having a dedicated "pilot's bag" will keep these tools and materials together and easily available. We recommend including the following in your pilot's bag:

- Sectional Chart (Klamath Falls and Seattle)
- Airport Directory
- Headset
- Knee board
- Colored flashlight (for night flying)
- Extra writing utensils
- Extra batteries (for noise cancelling headsets and flashlights)


# Memory Aids

We've all experienced a bit of "brain-fade" when, for whatever reason, you can't quite recall or grasp the idea you were searching for. It happens, and is no big deal…except when you're 3000 feet in the air and need to make a quick decision. That's when memory aids and mnemonic devices are our best friends! Below are a handful that are very helpful to pilots-in-training and experienced pilots alike. Here are some of our favorites:
