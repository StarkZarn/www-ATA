We have two (2) Cessna 152 airplanes – the most popular two-seat training aircraft ever made. Both have dual navigation / communication radios with glide slope capability for instrument approaches.

Additionally we have three (3) Cessna 172 airplanes – a very popular four-seat aircraft.  All three planes feature dual navigation / communication radios with glide slope capability and IFR approach-certified GPS units.

Finally, we have a Cessna 172 RG (retractable gear) which qualifies as a complex aircraft for the commercial pilot rating. This aircraft also has a dual navigation / communication radio with glide slope and DME (distance measuring equipment).
