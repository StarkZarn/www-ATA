  - description: 'I took my first airplane ride in a sea plane when I was 8 years old, and from that moment on I was hooked. I earned my private pilot license in 1981, and continued my pilot education by adding instrument ratings and a commercial license. In 1989 I received my flight instructor license and have been enjoying my time in the air ever since.<br /><br />
  
  Many instructors view teaching as a way to quickly log hours and move on to another type of flying. As an instructor, I already have the job I want. Simply put, I love to teach. For this reason, I believe my students benefit from my thousands of hours spent teaching flying as a career.<br /><br />
  
  I have taught students as young as 11 and others as old as 80. Everyone has a unique learning style, and it is rewarding to me to match my instructional approach to that style. Whether you are learning to fly for a pleasure, business, or as a career, I will match our program to your goals.'

  - description: "My love of planes and flying began at age 7 when I would head out to my Grandma\'s pasture with rubber band-powered balsa airplanes... hoping to not land in the cow pies. From there, my love of planes blossomed and by the time I was 17 I was washing and gassing airplanes at the original McKenzie Flying Service in Springfield, OR (now a Walmart). By age 20, I was a commercial pilot, flight instructor, and about to join the Air Force!<br /><br />
  
  Over the next several years, during my time in the Air Force, I continued to gain more experience as both a pilot and pilot instructor, flying T-38s in San Antonio, TX and teaching at the Air Force Aero Club in Champs & Cubs in Okinawa, Japan. By age 24, I was co-piloting DC-3s.<br /><br />
  
  After leaving the Air Force, I continued to fly as a commercial airline pilot, and also served for five years as an instructor (Check Airman) for Continental Airlines on the MD-82. At age 60, after 36 years of airline flying and approximately 29,000 hours, I set the parking brake for the last time on a B-777-200 in Houston, TX, after flying over the Pacific Ocean from Narita airport near Tokyo, Japan.<br /><br />
  
  My career as a pilot has been a heck of a ride, but I\'m not ready to stop flying yet! As an instructor, I love having fun and sharing my experience and experiences, while emphasizing solid, fundamental airmanship. With a flexible and adaptive schedule I am available for in-flight instruction as well as assistance with ground school academics and test preparation. Come out to the Creswell airport ATA office and take a Discovery Flight with me!"
