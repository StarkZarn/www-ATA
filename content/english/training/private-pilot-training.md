# Requirements

Keeping everyone safe is a top priority when flying a plane, so the FAA has made a variety of requirements that pilots must meet in order to be licensed (certified). Below is an outline of those requirements, as published by the FAA.
FAA Requirements to Become a Private Pilot:

    Be at least 17 years old
    Pass the FAA written examination
    Receive Instructor's endorsement
    Pass the FAA practical test
    Be able to read, speak and understand the English language

40 Hours Total Flight/Training Time which includes:

    20 Hours of Dual Flight Instruction
        3 Hours of Dual Night Flight
        3 Hours of Instrument Training
    10 Hours of Solo Flight
        5 Hours of Cross Country Flight
    10 Hours of Ground Instruction

It is important to note that these are the minimum training requirements to apply for the Private Pilot certificate. More time may be required to attain the necessary proficiency prior to your FAA Private Pilot practical examination. Currently, the national average is 70 to 80 hours.

# Ground School

Many important parts of learning to fly occur outside of a plane. For example, safe pilots understand the physics of how an airplane works, they can identify weather patterns and potential risk indicators, and they can read and utilize flight maps, to name just a few. There's a lot to know, and it takes time and dedication to learn it all – and that's why we have ground school.

But forget dry lectures, chalkboards, and the ever-present fear of pop quizzes. This isn't high school. This is ground school! And ground school at About Time Aviation means working at your pace, studying however/wherever you are comfortable, and feeling free to ask questions.

Utilizing the Gleim textbooks and study guides, your instructor will let you know which chapters to read and review before your next flying lesson. This allows you to study when you have the time and inclination, and to formulate questions for topics that require deeper insight and input from your instructor. At your next lesson, before you get back in the plane, your instructor will spend some one-on-one time with you to answer questions and review the parts of your studies that apply to the lesson – making it practical and more memorable. As your lessons progress, ground school will also be the time when your instructor helps you prepare for the written and oral portions of obtaining your pilot license.

This method of self-paced study followed by individual attention allows our instructors to discover how you learn best and provide the support you need to successfully reach your goals. And it works! The majority of our students score above 90% on their written exam and go on to be safe, alert pilots.

# Partner Training

Sometimes learning is more fun with a partner. You can study together, challenge each other, laugh and learn from each other's mistakes, take turns making faces at the instructor while he isn't looking…the sky's the limit! And at About Time Aviation, we're happy to accommodate.

Our Couples/Friends Training program is designed so two (2) people can share common instructor training time, as well as be in the plane with their partner during actual flying lessons. This double immersion training can be more cost effective, and also provides preview and reinforcement opportunities for lessons learned both on the ground and in the sky.
Other Benefits of Couples/Friends Training

    Friendly competition
    "Built-in" study partner/someone to hold the flashcards
    Establishes habits, rhythms, and safety awareness
    Strengthens communication skills
    Shared experiences and memories


Our Couples/Friends Training program is perfect for those who want to maximize their time in the sky, stretch their dollar, and have fun with a friend. Call us now to learn more about this exceptional opportunity that few other schools offer!
