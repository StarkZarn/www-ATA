# Glass Cockpit & EFB Training

## Technology Is Our Friend

#### iPad Training

As every pilot and pilot-in-training knows, there's a lot to be aware of and prepare for both before and during flight. Flight maps, flight plans, weather patterns, TFRs... it's all up to you! And while you have to learn/know the old-fashioned way of finding these things out for your pilot practical exam, technology has made it a lot easier for day-to-day flights.

While there are a lot of great apps and software available, at About Time Aviation, we really like ForeFlight Mobile – a flight planning and in-flight support app for pilots available on iPads and iPhones. Easy, convenient, and less cumbersome than pull-out maps and plate books, ForeFlight provides an incredible amount of information at your fingertips. Best of all, we're here to help you check it out!

If you would like to take a tour of ForeFlight (a test-run before you buy), or even lessons on how to use the various features, at About Time Aviation we're happy to accommodate you! Instructor Jess Everson is very familiar with the critically acclaimed app (he uses it himself) and can show you its benefits, limitations, and provide tips and tricks.
